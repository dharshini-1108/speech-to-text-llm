# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project implements a speech-to-text transcription pipeline aimed at enhancing transcription services using modern data analysis and machine learning tools.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook walks through a complete pipeline for converting speech to text, analyzing transcription accuracy, and visualizing results. It includes:

- Installation of required libraries
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Word Error Rate (WER) simulation
- Analysis and visualization of model outputs
- Integration of acoustic models and large language models (LLMs)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Data Cleaning`: Prepares and formats the dataset for analysis
- `Data Analysis`: Explores the dataset to understand patterns and quality
- `Visualization Tools`: Uses matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
- `WER Simulation`: Demonstrates the accuracy of transcription
- `Acoustic → LLM → Decoder`: Conceptual pipeline of the transcription process

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab environment (or Jupyter Notebook)
- Packages:
  - `kaggle`
  - `datasets`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `os`, `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install kaggle datasets matplotlib
```

## 📊 Output

- Transcription quality analysis
- Error rate metrics
- Visual representation of transcription performance

## 📌 Notes

- The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab.
- Ensure access to the Kaggle API if using datasets from Kaggle.
